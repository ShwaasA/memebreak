# memebreak

"memebreak" aims to distract you while you are working, ruin your productivity, and give you much needed breaks in lengthy computer sessions! However, we do respect important meetings and have implemented a system to delay a meme by up to 60 minutes because a meeting longer than that isn't worth going to without memes! Let's talk about the memes, so the memes are sourced from Reddit and are filtered to exclude any Not Safe For Work (NSFW) posts. There is even a never ending next feature where you can get lost in the world of instant gratification!
